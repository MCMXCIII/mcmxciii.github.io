# Fuck Health insurance.

As someone who has been going through some crazy health issues recently. I have been having the crazier experience with doctors and healthcare as a whole.

# The Inital Panic
So thank god for my new job and the health insurance plan I am on. The whole health insurance thing is out of control.

So in March of this year I went and grabbed temporary insurance because I was having nasty stomach pains and trying to be rpoactive I started to seek out health insurance. At this point I know of health insurance but I don;t really know how to get it. I was on my mother's insurance for a while but besides that I just know that I have to get it. Scrambling to find a policy that will cover anything at this point and like the smart person I am(Sarcasm) I look to reddit to try to solve my problem in the form of questions and panicked typing at people over the internet.

*Then*... I found it. United Health care's temporary insurance policy I saw that it would cover me going to the ER and some other tests and seeing some specialists and I was sold on that I read the contract and saw that I would probably definately get super fucked over in the long run but I did it anyway. The crazy thing I did think about while running around on the internet looking for policies and plans is that I for the life of me couldn't find anything related to buying a plan from other companies that gave full coverage like Humana or Aetna.

After I calmed down and started to actually research what I was doing and starting to think with some rational thought I realsied that I had missed "Open Enrollment" I kept seeing those words over and over again on every page and every piece of fine print I could get my hands on and none of the papers or fine print I read would explain what the fuck it actually was. After some consuling and more googling and search and forums and reading I learned that This early enrollment is just a period where you have the ability to get full coverage in a nut shell with some exceptions that I will talk about later but for the most part if you don't get health insurance for the most part you are pretty much fucked and you are left to your own devices for the most part.

# Becoming health care savvy?
So at this point I got Temporary health care / what they called a supplemenrary health plan and I the the panic is still there but I am thinking now I am reading and thats always a good thing when you are not in the know and brancd new to anything. So with alot of my new found knwoledge I got that I need healthcare I got some form of it so I am not completely fucked and I bought some time to help me learn what this is all about so. So am I at this point? I hey some temp insurance. I have been to the ER and an urgent care after freaking the fuck out and I some of the bills are starting to roll in. I am calm because of the have the money but I am still worried because I know that I don't have full coverage. I didn't really know what that meant yet but I started to get an idea. I had recently started my job what I was a subcontractor and was waiting out a probationary period where I would become full time with another company that was also contracting and me being the dumbass I was neglected to signup with the health care with the sub contractor when they offered partially because I didn't know what I was signing up for and I didn't know I needed it till I started getting symptoms. 

# Finally getting medical benefits
2 Weeks pass and I am getting full time status and with that I am getting the benefits and I pretty excited about how I can pick my primary care provider and see doctor's in my network but where this all goes wrong for me is when I start actually seeing a doctor. I see a doctor it takes forever I am still spending money and then I when I do get the tests I need I am still stuck waiting for weeks at a time.

 am schduled for a scope test but when I was scheduled I was schduled almost 7 weeks from the time I saw the doctor. For the amount of money changing hands this is a little rediculous. I am not saying that we should just let this go and be a thing now.

 It's essentially apart of american culture now to just bend over and get fucked by healthcare companies and just take it and pay crazy amounts of money to them.

Welp thats's why I started this blog.

To showcase some of the fuckery that goes on for people who don't know how bad it actually is because I know I didn't know how bad it was till it happened to me.

So stay tuned for the articles and other posts about the health care system here in my country and the wild ride it took me on as I explain in more detail and give people more insight into the comapnies they pay for the pivilege of being treated by doctors at a hospital.

Although the name of the blog is healthcareisbullshit.com I will post about all kinda of corperate fuckery and give my take on it.

I hope everyone reading gets something good out of my content rather it be some insight into the healthcare industry as a whole as I delve deeper into the inner working. Some data that I scrape from differenthealth care providers and some pricing data about policies and plans that I will make available to the best of my ability to do so.

If you like my content please share it with a friend and share on social media. Any kind of exposure helps.


Thanks.
