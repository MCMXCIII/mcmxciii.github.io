## Research and finding on gut health and related topics.

I started this page as a way to aggregate all things I found on gut helath and topics related to gut health. My curiosity was sparked after I started going to bad bouts of gas, bloating and heartburn and started to look for not just remedies but ways to combat the problem at the roots and not just taking dugs to subside the symptopms of the gut issues.


## Gut health and Biome Findings

I starting my search at the root of the issues which is just starting out with detailing everything I know about digestions and how food is processed in the body.

The first thing I know of about the prcess is the stomach isn't just a tube that tunnels food it's a  series of tubes intistines and colon and large intistines and foods are broen down with stomach acids.
I wanted to focus more on the acids to start because of my bout with heart burn and gas and the gas comes from the acid bubbling from the foods I ate breking down and building pressure without a release.

Turns out that the stomach can't just break down things with just acid it makes uuse of the bacteria in the gut to help bring things to a good developing digestion cycle.

One of the side effects is that I feel tire during the day. I am looking at changin my diet for the better. But something I have been looking at bone broth. I have been looking up alot of information about broth and soup and high qaulity broth.

Watching a video about broth by Kaayla Daniel P.h.D. Where she talks about the beginnings of broth and how the beginning of soup were formed. She talks about everything from the history to the begginings of the health benefits and the science behind of it.

The link to this video is below here

one of the most interesting things in the video I have seen in the video is the idea of eating all of the animal and this is something that started to click with me in the video. She compares the broth of the modern times to the about using the whole animal when amking soup. She also says that we should be making a variety of soups watch the full video for the info and the doctor's thoughts.

## Probiotics

Based on what I have learned about the gut and how it works I have learned that the linign of the gut is pretty much bathed in acid pretty much since you are able to eat solid foods and this lining is vulnerable to bad diets and can really fuck up your lifestyle if not taken care of your gut biome and t

## Marrow

Something else I started to look at is Marrow which seems to be somethin that is key in bone broth and it's the marrow from the bones in the broth I am still looking into the actual nutrinial profile of marrow but everyone and all culutres pretty much says the same thing about marrow. It's one of the best foods for humans and it's considered one of the most primal foods to eat seeing how it's what the earliest humans ate. So far in my finding Marrow seems to have different types depedning on the bones and the health of the animal the bone was taken from.


## Collagen

Another key to the broth is colagen and this does wonders for joints and the helps the gut by supporting the lining on the stomach to prevent and treat alot of different ailments when it come to the gut this also will help bring about healthy skin,bones,hair and nails. This is a key part of bone broth and one of the reasons it is so beneficial.
