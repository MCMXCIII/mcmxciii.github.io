## My new go to Coffee spot.

Near my job and pretty trendy literal coffee bar with a coffee bar by morning and day and becoming a full fledged bar by night even including food and full course meals. There motto "Coffe, Cocktails, Provisions." and it does this very well with the perfection combonation of Coffee balencing food and alcohol. 


This little shop even sells glass mugs and it isn't at a crazy price being around 20 bucks for a decnet glass mug to use. I haven't seen any actual monogramed merch in the store. Even on the website I can't find any monogrammed merch but I am sure it does exist seeing how I have seen a barista at the shop with a bandana type scarf. 

But how is the coffee you asl? One word. Great. I have tasted most of the menu and if you are coming here for a classic cappuccino this little store is for you. A decently priced drink and expertly crafted  especially if you not a fan of sweet things. Even with there coffee menu of sweet ethiopian coffees that are excellently crafted. I honestly think that the choice of flavors of the coffess and teas on the menu as of writing this post are excellent for welcoming spring with alot of easy going coffee with sweet notes but not sweet to the point where it's hard to drink without fear of a sugar crash.

Overall I am happy to find this little shop and I bought a cappuccino here almost everyday since starting my new job the staff is nice and the atmosphere is great and located in one of the best spots for the type of crowd it tries to attract. For all of those in the library of congress, those on the hill and all of those south of the capitol make your way over here to fuel those late nights researching ,speeches and meetings and for those bloggers who need to keep on writing.
