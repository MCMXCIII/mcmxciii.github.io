## Campfire food truck.

This food truck here that I was showed over here south of the capitol seels some bomb cheesesteaks and fries.

I grabbed a a sandwish to see what all the hype was about. 

Picture of the menu.

The menu looks pretty simple featureing fries cheesesteaks and wings. To make tings better they also serve combos for those who want a drink with their meal.

Here's te menu.

The Truck seems so geniune you and the staff seem real and that's something that makes this food truck special there are food trucks that have staff that are just there for the money and usually not from the area but the people working on the truck seemed like the real deal and know about the city even hookin up regulars.

The guy I spoke who I assume is the owner even hooked me up with some free fries. This is something I definatley look for in trucks like this.

I grabbed a simple cheese steak that Campfire calls a "Cali Cheesesteak" pretty simple meat, cheese,lettece and mayo and my friend got something I couldn't find on the menu "Cheesesteak Old Bay Fries." I got a photo of this monstrosity and oh my god I should have got what he got the fries are something of a legend for comfort food and for a cold friday nothing could have beaten this for a relaxing workday.

Here is a photo of my friend's fries.

In terms of comfort food I would call this epic.


Be sure to give Campfire a try if you get the chance and check them out on social media they have a twitter and instagram as well as facebook.


Overall rating 3.5/5

Campfire gets this rating because of a few things.

1.Price -  The sandwich itsself is 8 bucks and although it isn't taxed if you pay cash it's still prett high even for most of D.C. prices. I am sure they would have much better business if the prices were toned down just a little bit.

2. Hours and Atmosphere - From what I have been told is the truck doesn't stay around long enough and the truck isnt too appealing when your up close and personal the food is home grown but the appearance of the truck may shy some potential customers away.

With these in mind the place isn't too bad and if you are into comfort food you should definately drop by for some cheeseteak fries.
