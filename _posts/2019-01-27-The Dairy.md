## The Dairy

### College Park, MD

The Dairy is a small little Ice Cream Shop located inside the Adele Stamp Building. They don;t have too many flavors but it's a good little shop that will hookup you if you wanted. I have a big heart for small business and you all should know that I have tendency to befriend people and make alot of friends.

Be sure to try the exclusive flavors peanut better friese and UMD flavor. You don't see too many ice cream parlors like this and it's right next to other fod options. My general move is get some dinner or lunch and then hop over to the dairy to get a double scoop.

One of the cons of the dairy is that you can't mix flavors without buying a double scoop.
It kinda sucks if you are trying to watch how much you eat but I am sure they would do if the manager isnt around and you ask nicely.

overall I rate the dairy 4/5

I always have a tedency to rate small business higher but in this case the dairy got the rating it got because of all of the factors.
