## Daikaya - Izakaya Ramen
### Washington, D.C.

So I need someone to correct me if I am wrong but this place just might be the most popular ramen spot i the the city. There is always luines out of the door at this place and all times of the day.

At being said if you walk in during a crowded day generally what will happen is a server will how many people are in your party and ask for a phone number and they will give you an estimate for when a table will be ready and they'll send you a text message when it's ready so you can come back and not have to wait in such a long line.

Checking out the menu we have a pretty good selection it isn't too crazy but that in my opinion is a good thnig to focus on what you do best and having a narrow menu mean I am in for a good dish. With some of the classics such as Shio Ramen with shitan stock, miso, spicy miso, musi mugi, shoyu and an al vegatable ramen for the vegans out there don;t forget the addons like extra chasu and extra noodles and even some good gyoza if you're in the mood. Honestly the prices aren't that bad for the city on average. At just around 13-15 bucks for a bowl after taxes. It's not too pricy but definately more procey than the alternatives in and around city.

Daikaya is decked out with alot of the traditional japanese pop-up ramen shop decor everythin from the art and the hanging on the wall with a little bit of modern flair with the movie posters in the bathrooms. Servers are pretty friendly and are pretty responsive and pretty quick when serving their tables.

Overall atmosphere of the shop there are bars withs stool that serve as tables and while it's not the authentic experience with servers the ramen and the overall vibe of the resturant make up for the authenticity.


Definately check this place out if you are in the area and if you're reading this during resturant week the head chef Katsuya Fukushima at Daikaya is hooking people up with a special menu for tasting at the resturant check out [Daikaya](www.daiakaya.com) for the regular menu and the resturant week menu.



Down below are some pictres of the dish I got and some random shots I got of the place before leaving.
