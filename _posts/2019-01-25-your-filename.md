## Food Run?

###When your boss gives you cash to go on a food run.

I love my job especially when my boss tells me that eating is apart of my job.

Just in case yall didn't know Popeyes has a deal that is usually at most locations where you can buy 10 pieces for 11$.

Somehow my boss got a another deal where we got 40 pieces for 41 bucks not bad.

Not Bad.
